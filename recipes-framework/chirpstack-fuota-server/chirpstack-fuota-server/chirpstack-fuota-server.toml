  # PostgreSQL dsn (e.g.: postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable).
  #
  # Besides using an URL (e.g. 'postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable')
  # it is also possible to use the following format:
  # 'user=chirpstack_ns dbname=chirpstack_ns sslmode=disable'.
  #
  # The following connection parameters are supported:
  #
  # * dbname - The name of the database to connect to
  # * user - The user to sign in as
  # * password - The user's password
  # * host - The host to connect to. Values that start with / are for unix domain sockets. (default is localhost)
  # * port - The port to bind to. (default is 5432)
  # * sslmode - Whether or not to use SSL (default is require, this is not the default for libpq)
  # * fallback_application_name - An application_name to fall back to if one isn't provided.
  # * connect_timeout - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not specified means wait indefinitely.
  # * sslcert - Cert file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
  # * sslkey - Key file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
  # * sslrootcert - The location of the root certificate file. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
  #
  # Valid values for sslmode are:
  #
  # * disable - No SSL
  # * require - Always SSL (skip verification)
  # * verify-ca - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA)
  # * verify-full - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name matches the one in the certificate)
